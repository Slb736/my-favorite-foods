	<h1>The Best Foods</h1>
	<hr>
	<h4>Steak</h4>
	<p>Steak is one of my favorite foods. I love the flavor and the many different varities, as well as the different ways to cook it. ALl of these things makes it one of my faovrites. My favorite type of steak is a ribeye steak cooked medium rare, since its flavor is the consitently best to me. However, I aslo really like prime rib, sirloin and filet. I only like my steaks cooked medium, medium rare, or rare, since I think well done takes away all of the flavor.</p>
	
	<h4>Sushi</h4>
	<p>Sushi is the other one of my favorite foods. Although it tastes very different, it is like steak in its variety and customization, as well as how delicious it tastes, making it one of my favorites. My favorite type of sushi is a really hard choice since there is so many different options depending on where you eat. However, my favorite sushi roll that is mostly universal between restaurants is the rainbow roll, which is a california roll topped with an assortment of fish. I also eat my sushi with a soy sauce-wasbi mixture to add spice and enhance the flavor.</p>
